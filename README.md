# 🔥 Calories Burned Prediction using Linear Regression

This project focuses on predicting the number of calories burned during exercise using personal and activity-based information. By applying a supervised machine learning approach—specifically Linear Regression—it learns patterns from physiological data and workout details to estimate calorie burn accurately.

## 📌 Project Overview

• Built a Linear Regression model to predict calories burned

• Features include age, gender, height, weight, duration, and heart rate

• Explored and cleaned data before applying regression

• Visualized relationships and evaluated model performance with standard metrics

## 📊 Dataset Description

The dataset includes the following features:

• Age, Gender, Height, Weight

• Duration (min), Heart Rate, Body Temperature

• Calories burned (Target variable)

## ⚙️ Tools & Technologies

• Language: Python

• Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, Matplotlib

• Model: Linear Regression (from sklearn.linear_model)

• Evaluation Metrics: R² Score, Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error

## 📈 Key Results

• Linear Regression provided a baseline model for calorie prediction

• Identified positive correlation between heart rate/duration and calories burned

• Achieved reasonable accuracy with minimal overfitting
